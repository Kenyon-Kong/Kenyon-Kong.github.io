## About me
I'm Xiangrui Kong, a senior student in the Honors College of Computer Science at Purdue Univeristy. As an undergraduate student, I have completed coursework in compliers, operating systems, algorithm, machine learning and deep learning. My academic interests are in machine learning and algorithms. While I have some research experience in computer vision, I am eager to learn and explore other areas within the machine learning industry.

## Experience

[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16256)
[Project Website](https://dl3dv-10k.github.io/DL3DV-10K/)

Collected 400+ valid data videos, and also labeled, categorized and analyzed 2000+ data samples

### Integrating Symbolic Reasoning Into Neural Generative Models For 3D-Space Design Generation
[Paper](asset/final report.pdf)

Replicated and improved the extended version of SPRINGV2 using Jupyter Notebook, mainly involving three modules: 
perception module, spatial reasoning module and visual element generator module 
Learned and utilized neural network models for object detection (DETR50), Segment-Anything (SAM), and depth 
estimation (Depth- Anything) in the perception pipeline 
Designed new method for improving post-processing results for wall detection, increased the accuracy for boundary 
detection from 30% to 90% 
Improved segmentation accuracy by eliminating repetitive detection, eliminating redundancy and errors up to 90 
percent for a custom dataset 



## Personal Project
### Starting Great Adventure: A Deep Dive into Stable Diffusion 
[Paper](asset/Final_Report.pdf)

Literature-reviewed diffusion related papers, familiarized with math concepts behind diffusion models 
Reconstructed Stable Diffusion v-1.5 from scratch using Pytorch library, and loaded pre-trained weights for forward 
inference 
Implemented the entire DDPM pipeline including data loader, network structure, as well as training pipeline targeting 
smaller datasets 
Conducted successful image generation experiments on the Stable Diffusion v-1.5. 
Achieved clear class recognition in generated images for dataset like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 on the 
DDPM model 
Built a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook tutorial including math section and coding section for future educational use.

### C Compiler for MiniJava

Utilized Yacc, Lex and Bison to handle java code recognition. 
Implemented Linked List and Tree structure in constructing Abstract syntax tree and symbol table
Constructed code for transforming java code into assembly code including  memory allocation for primitive variables and arrays, basic execution for branch operations and method call, ect. The built compiler can finish most of  the tasks of a real Java language compiler.
Optimized memory allocation using hardware register by implementing k-coloring algorithm

# C++ & C Shell Terminal

Implemented Yacc and Lex to recognize commands grammar
Utilized builtin system calls for executing, redirecting, and piping
Constructed additional features including auto-complete typing, input command history table, sub-shell, and arrow keys
