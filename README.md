## About me
I'm Xiangrui Kong, a senior student in the Honors College of Computer Science at Purdue Univeristy. As an undergraduate student, I have completed coursework in compliers, operating systems, algorithm, machine learning and deep learning. My academic interests are in machine learning and algorithms. While I have some research experience in computer vision, I am eager to learn and explore other areas within the machine learning industry.

## Reserach Project
### DL3DV-10K: A Large-Scale Scene Dataset for Deep Learning-based 3D Vision (CVPR 2024)
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16256)
[Project Website](https://dl3dv-10k.github.io/DL3DV-10K/)

During this project, I collected over 400 valid video samples and meticulously labeled, categorized, and analyzed more than 2,000 data samples to support research objectives. I contributed to the development of the research webpage and participated in visualizing data insights using the ECharts library. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with the academic research process, actively engaging in regular research meetings. This work culminated in a publication that has been accepted for presentation at CVPR 2024.

### Integrating Symbolic Reasoning Into Neural Generative Models For 3D-Space Design Generation
[Paper](asset/final report.pdf)

In this project, I replicated and enhanced an extended version of SPRINGV2 using Jupyter Notebook, focusing on three key modules: the perception module, spatial reasoning module, and visual element generator module. I applied neural network models such as DETR50 for object detection, Segment-Anything (SAM) for segmentation, and Depth-Anything for depth estimation within the perception pipeline. Additionally, I developed a new method to improve post-processing accuracy for wall detection, raising boundary detection accuracy from 30% to 90%. I also enhanced segmentation accuracy by reducing repetitive detections and minimizing redundancy and errors by up to 90% for a custom dataset.

## Personal Project
### Starting Great Adventure: A Deep Dive into Stable Diffusion 
[Paper](asset/Final_Report.pdf)

In this project, I conducted a literature review of diffusion-related papers and developed a strong understanding of the mathematical foundations behind diffusion models. I reconstructed Stable Diffusion v-1.5 from scratch using the PyTorch library and integrated pre-trained weights for forward inference. I implemented the full Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) pipeline, including the data loader, network structure, and training pipeline, specifically optimized for smaller datasets. I ran successful image generation experiments on Stable Diffusion v-1.5, achieving high-quality, class-recognizable outputs on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Additionally, I created a detailed Jupyter Notebook tutorial, covering both mathematical explanations and code implementations, to support future educational use.

### C Compiler for MiniJava
[Project Repository](https://github.com/Kenyon-Kong/C-Compiler-for-MiniJava.git)

In this project, I used Yacc, Lex, and Bison to enable Mini-Java code recognition within a custom compiler. I implemented data structures such as Linked Lists and Trees to construct the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and symbol table. I also developed code to transform Mini-Java code into assembly code, handling tasks such as memory allocation for primitive variables and arrays, executing branch operations, and managing method calls. The resulting compiler was capable of performing most tasks expected of a real Java language compiler. To optimize memory allocation, I applied a k-coloring algorithm for efficient hardware register usage.

### C++ & C Shell Terminal

Implemented Yacc and Lex to recognize commands grammar
Utilized builtin system calls for executing, redirecting, and piping
Constructed additional features including auto-complete typing, input command history table, sub-shell, and arrow keys
